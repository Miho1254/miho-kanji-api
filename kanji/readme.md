# Introduction

## Jukugo 
Kanji in Japanese, when created from two individual Chinese characters, is often called "jukugo" (熟語). Jukugo are compound words where two or more kanji are combined together to form a new word with a specific meaning. For example, the word "学校" (gakkou), meaning school, is formed from two kanji: "学" (learn) and "校" (school). Jukugo are very common in Japanese and include many important and necessary vocabulary items.

## Single
Single Chinese characters in Japanese are called "kandokusha" (漢独者). This term refers to Kanji that by themselves already have an independent meaning and do not need to be combined with other Kanji. For example, the character "木" means tree and "水" means water. These Kanji often appear independently in texts or are used in simple compound words.
